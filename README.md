# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction-Kaggle


## Problem Statement
Predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

## Approach
- Performed exploratory Data analysis on 79 explanatory variables with NaNs and used rigorous feature engineering techniques
- Used one hot, label, count & target guided mean encoding techniques with multiple analysing the features
- Scaled and processed data is trained with ANNs, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, Boost, and Extra Trees
- Best fit in each model is obtained using grid-search hyperparamter tuning and the final model used was based
on optimal weighted average combination of models by brute force search of parameters to reduce RMSE 

## Data
